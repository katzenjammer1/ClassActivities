Overall, this activity was  a great way to review overloading functions and operators. Making a class and creating methods
is normally a simple task, but the review was necessary after a long while since coding in C++. We were able to refresh our minds 
on how C++ handles with pointers and object overloading and its uses with objects. In the project specifically,
we were able to easily create objects where users can input their own data with the >> operator being replaces.
This review was great to solidify a solid chunk of what we learned in CMPE 50. There was a huge learning curve on the syntax on the most part
but after drawing the connections to where everything was connected to, it was pretty simple.
